[Intro: Chris Brown]
I'll hold you down
I'm on my way, DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Jeremih & August Alsina]
All you've been thinking 'bout
Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind, rule your mind
And now you say you dreaming of doing it anywhere
Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind, on your mind
Sit in my whip and see the stars, and see the stars
Show me just who you are, show me just who you are
You know who really hold you down, hold you down
And when you not around, when you not around

[Chorus: August Alsina & Jeremih]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up in that Bentley truck cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now
You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me
I'm on my way
I'm the one's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I had some problems back home, so I heated up
I ain't with that bullshit at all, then I laid it down
Maybe it's that Virginia in me, nigga say something
Have a young nigga go so hard
Oh but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like a coward when he hit me
Get me? Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I lift that ass up off the ground
I'mma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been serving
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'mma take you away
And I'll hold you down, I'mma hold you down
I'mma hold you down baby

[Chorus: August Alsina & Jeremih]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up in that Bentley truck cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now
You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me
I'm on my way
I'm the one's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down

[Verse 3: Future]
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roads is down, you mesmerised by the flying sky
We gotta socialise and cherish times
This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini, the doors in the sky
Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
We've been playing in that Versace
We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby
Your body my new Bugatti

[Chorus: August Alsina & Jeremih]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up in that Bentley truck cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now
You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me
I'm on my way
I'm the one's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down

[Verse 4: August Alsina & (DJ Khaled)]
Live an expensive life and I'm just getting started
I get instant hype cause you forever my lady, forever my baby, (Real life)
Hold you down, hold you down, girl you helped me up when I was down, in and out, girl
Hold you down like I'm supposed to, real nigga, I know you, real nigga, I know you, (another one)

[Chorus: August Alsina, Jeremih & Chris Brown]
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up in that Bentley truck cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now
You the one got all I need, give me all of you or all of me
I'm on my way
I'm the one's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down
