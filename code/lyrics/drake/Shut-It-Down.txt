[Intro: Drake]
These girls ain't got nothing on you...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
All the girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
Golly is she pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

[Interlude: Drake & The-Dream]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
Ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Killer, killer

[Verse 2: The-Dream & Drake]
Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it and together we'd—

[Hook]
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

[Bridge: The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around its obvious—

[Hook: Drake & The-Dream]
You shut that thing down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
You shut it down, you shut it—
And they'd notice, they'd notice

[Interlude: The-Dream]
You looking good girl
Go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl
Go, go, go—go, go, go
You looking good girl
Go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl
Go, go, go—go go go
You shut it down

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type
You wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me lay you down, down, down

[Outro]
I’m trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, round, round
They notice  they notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around
And they notice they notice, you would shut it
