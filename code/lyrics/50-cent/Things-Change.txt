[50 Cent (Chorus)]
Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

[Spider Loc (Verse)]
All money ain't good money, this i know
But i still love hood money, it gets my dough
And as a youngster, that nigga went through so much church
That still turned out fucked up, i did so much dirt
Told to bang the neighbourhood, i put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't done on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit jus runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef, the week wasn't complete
Its like a nigga felt better after dumpin this heat
On feet, just to see the body slumped in the seat
Its like a whole 'nother rush to me, bussin' was sweet
Now im smarter, im all about something to eat
Im on the road spend 30 days a month in the suite
But im still gon' hustle and cheat, Lets Go Now!

[50 Cent (Chorus)]
Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

[Lloyd Banks(Verse)]
Yeah, uh..
Now walkin down the block without your weapon
Its a first class ticket to a lesson (uh huh)
I first cast tickets to perfection, me and Ben got a connection (yeah)
That's why i bring the Benz out to impress him (yeah)
Caught in my zone, all alone, homes rattlin' my bones
Cuz he yappin' off his lips and if i hit him i be wrong
Cuz he ain't never gon' be shit, i done work so hard
But i will make you a corn of the cob, you be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas would pull your cards
I don't know about y'all star, cuz my nigga gone
H.P tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your llama
There'll be funeral arrangements for your momma
I learnd that when i was in pajamas watchin Micheal and Madonna
Now i got the appetite of a piranna, nigga

[50 Cent (Chorus)]
Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

[Spider Loc (Verse)]
Haha.. Haha
When nobody knows all the walls you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to, for crumbs
Damn tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Two
There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

[50 Cent (Chorus)]
Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
