Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
Yes I did (realize)
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib (realize)
Just a little something, show you how we live (realize)
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious (realize)
Mhm, that's that shit (realize)
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Verse 1]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is (realize)
You don't see just how fly my style is (realize)
I don't see why I need a stylist (realize)
When I shop so much I can speak Italian (realize)
I don't know I just want it better for my kids (realize)
And I ain't saying we was from the projects (realize)
But every time I wanna layaway or deposit (realize)
My dad'd say "when you see clothes, close your eyelids" (realize)
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son (realize)
In the movie -- I ain't talking 'bout the rich ones (realize)
Cause every summer
He'll get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from (realize)
And I don't know what he did for dough (realize)
But he'll send me back to school with a new wardrobe

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
I think he did (realize)
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib (realize)
Just a little something, show you how we live (realize)
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious (realize)
Mhm, that's that shit (realize)
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Verse 2]
When it feel like living's harder than dying (realize)
For me giving up's way harder than trying (realize)
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion (realize)
I wish her heart still was in rhyming (realize)
Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh? (realize)
I guess me if it isn't you (realize)
Last week I paid a visit to the institute (realize)
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school (realize)
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do (realize)
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle (realize)
They got the CD, they got to see me (realize)
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE (realize)
They used to feel invisible (realize)
Now they know they invincible

[Bridge]
This is the story of a champion (realize)
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns (realize)
Stand up stand up here he comes (realize)
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 (realize)
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 (realize)
