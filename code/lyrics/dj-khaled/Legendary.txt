[Intro: Keyshia Cole]
You know, I've seen some things
It's important to stay strong
What's up DJ Khaled?
It's your girl KC

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If not they, then who?
Can carry on the weight of this world?
If not they, then who?
Will make sure all the people know how it feels to be legendary

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby don't cry no more
Cause I'm here to show you the way
I know you got some fight in you, oh
So don't make losing so easy, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Everybody's gonna fight and everybody's gonna fall
But the ones that get up are always the strongest
Oh I can't imagine if I never went through nothing
I wouldn't be a fighter and I wouldn't last the longest no

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Legends are born and created
Nothing's free, so I take it
It takes the determination
We going in, the nation

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Everybody's gonna fight and everybody's gonna fall
But the one's who get up are always the strongest
Oh I can't imagine if I never went through nothing
I wouldn't be a fighter and I wouldn't last the longest

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
I promise I'mma do it better than anybody's ever seen
That I will be everything that everybody told me I would never be no
Got my feet on the ground, the wind at my back, my head to the sky
No, not ever, you can see in my eyes I will be legendary

[Chorus]

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I remember when they told me no
I looked them right in their eyes and I told 'em yes
Don't let nobody stop your dreams, keep winning, rise to the top
Keep your head up, young world, the world is yours, we the best, YMCMB
