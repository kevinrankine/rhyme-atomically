[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
The price of fame (shit real)
Fuck fame, (man fuck this shit)
Fuck the game (DJ Khaled!)

[Hook: Future]
Got too many racks on me
I can't even go to sleep
Just to get em out V.I.P
I'mma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you)
I'm sufferin'
I'm sufferin' from success
I'm sufferin'

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Ace Hood
Fuck this money nigga, fuck this chain
Fuck my watch, you can have that ring
Keep my whips, you can have that fame
So stressed out, I'm going insane
Young nigga can't even sleep at night
All this money I done seen in life
More cash bring more haters
Fuck around and went and bought a chopper twice
Cause I'm paranoid, and I bury boy
If he playin' with mine, then it's oh lord
Please don't make a nigga do that
Please don't make a nigga do that
You dont' know what the fuck I been through
Plus my lawyer texting me too
Boy my baby momma be trippin'
Talking bout child support, I can't do it
I don't trust nobody but God
All these foreign's parked in my yard
Swear last night I swimmed in that money
Then woke up in a million dollar car
Boy I'm too stressed, so blessed
Please somebody pray for me
I'm suffering from success, Lord have mercy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Future]
My momma told me when I was a little bity boy, I was blessed
Frustrated

[Verse 2: Future]
Nigga fuck that car, fuck these hoes
Fuck these millions, fuck your feelings
I'm sufferin, I'm sufferin
Fuck this house, fuck this condo
Fuck these models, fuck these bottles
I'm sufferin', I'm sufferin'

[Hook] + [Bridge]
