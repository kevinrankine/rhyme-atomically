[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sara Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you bad enough that you don't even really need it
You could show at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your possie partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your virgin island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spendin'
Screamin'

[Hook: Santigold]
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
My name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bar's surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over stand me, I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandanna
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit like A la-la-lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I pick that pussy better, better than her gynecologist
Ho just, text me whenever you want some more dick, more dick
Old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damnnnnn, all I got is one dick

[Hook: Santigold]
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie

[Bridge: Santigold]
I got the talk
The beat and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me
In this ra-race

[Hook: Santigold]
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
I Got To Be Unstoppable
I Got To Be Unstoppable
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie
