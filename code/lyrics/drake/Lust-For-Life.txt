[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all, tonight
I got plans, I got a certain lust, for life
And as it stands, everything is going as right
As it can; they tryna shoot down my flight
Before it lands...before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (no, no, no)
My ex sendin' late night text
Cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin in the coldâ€”ah yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all... in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Every time... that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh...and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux
I don't really give a fuck and we only gettin older
So what I tend to do is to think... of today... as the past
It's funny when you comin in first
But you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

[Outro]
Throw your ones up in the aiiir
Throw your ones up in the air for her, ooh-oh
Throw your ones up, in the air
Throw your ones up
