Swear the god touched 10 mil, I swear

Big pistols, young nigga so real
If the whole hood known, put the whole city on his back
And they never took another soul, never took his back

Fuck niggas wanna live my life
(I swear I never tell another soul)

(I swear I never tell another soul)

(I swear I never tell another soul)

(I swear I never tell another soul)
I know a nigga that's doin' life
All because his codeine had fo'
All his hoe cars and the keys that he sold
That fuck nigga told
His home boy was a D-Boy
But he act like a CI, takin' notes like a PI
Carried on like a peon
You see a fuck nigga holler "FBI"
I've seen him on First 48
Said he had everything on tape
And he the nigga with the gun and the drum
And his hands hold and fuck nigga turned staple
That nigga, that 5-0 told somethin'
'Bout a nigga that put him on on death row
These niggas too cutthroat
And as you knew, niggas got the game all fucked up
