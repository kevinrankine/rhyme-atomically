[Intro: Mavado]
Ahhhh haaa
Pass the Guiness
Yahhh
Gully Gad, from Kingston
Yahh yahh
We the best music

[Hook: Mavado]
So suicidal, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist
So suicidal, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist

[Verse 1: Mavado]
So mi say be careful a di road dem weh yuh walk
Some a carry drugs and some a dem have dutty heart
Chat in front yuh face, dem wah fi kill you when you pass
You dem woulda lost
So it's best if you nuh talk
Am on another level like a Noah wid dah Ark
Am mi nuh fair di devil with the fork
Touch Gullyside guns smoke and guns bark
All a mi enimies dead off

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mavado]
Every street, every block
Gullyside and a me
Tell dem we the best is just a family
From Kingston, Jamaica to Miami
We taking over, lead mek dem falla we
Sing this
Every Gangsta pon dem corner
A some di marijuana
Far as dem eyes can see
Mi a di real thing
From New York to California
To Arizona dem haffi set we free
Old Gangalee
God if you with me
Show the light just let me know
Light just let me know
You know, hands in the sky if you with me
It's the gullyside life you know
You now... you know...

[Hook]
