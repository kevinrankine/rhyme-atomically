[Intro: DJ Khaled]
On everything I love, It’s We The Best Music
It’s We The Best over everything
Get money, mo’ money

[Hook: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
You know I got that check on me, you know I got that 9 on me
Play with it or get religious, these shots’ll make your shirt holey
Say please lord, forgive a nigga, actin’ up like Ben Stiller
Jewelry on me so fuckin’ cold, I gotta wear it with a chinchilla
I ball on these fuck niggas, Bron-Bron, D Wade
Whip white like cocaine, too dope, Rick James
I’m hardbody, my flow sick, that Eagle on me no Mike Vick
I bob and weave in that pussy good and I knock it out like Tyson
Say first round, face down, ass up, straight pound
Yeah, shorty, she know the deal and that’s every time that I come ‘round
This big business, I come around, smoking on that too loud
Give my dog about 1200, in twenty minutes he goin’ down

[Hook]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

[Verse 2: Vado]
It’s my year, Slime here
Cartier box face, call it the time’s square
Why year, I drive and fly Lear
V-16, need a coupe with nine gears
Yeah! Mob member, star agenda
Serve niggas over these bars like bartenders (Yes!)
I bob cats while shooting like guard Kemba
Hard in the paint, I stretch it, Lew Alcindor
F it, you all dinners, no protection
Tired of hearing these deadlines, no reception
Need work like wi-fi, no connection
We The Best men be the best in, cause

[Hook]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
They think I’ma gun ‘em down
Just ‘cause I’m a motherfucking king from the underground
Rest in peace, Pimp, name live long as Bun around
Niggas know me, 100 keys, 500 pounds
Way too advanced for these lames, had to dumb it down
Nigga try to run off with some change, I’ma hunt him down
All they do is run they mouth; me, I just run the town
Cause the industry is being ran by a bunch of clowns
Circus: it hurts
Cause everybody’s a boss and nobody’s the workers (Real shit)
Shit is getting weird
All I know is when I look ‘em in the eyes they be scared

[Hook]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down
