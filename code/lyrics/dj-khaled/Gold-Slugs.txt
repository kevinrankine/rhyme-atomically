She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' (Khaled, I see you my nigga)
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
She love the way, she love the way
She loves the way, the way it feels
When her body touch, her body touch your grill

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'ma pull up when she call me
Baby, you know I don't pull out when we lovin'
Touchin', kissin', and lickin'
Always leavin' your panties or somethin' else
In my crib or my whip, I'm shinin' with this gold grill
I could give a fuck how you feel
The ass and them titties on the real
I took her back to my block, nigga my hood
Now everybody, everybody like
"Damn that girl look good"
And every nigga in the squad gon' keep it 100
She can tell that I'm a boss and I tell her
She loves it, oh she loves the grill

[Hook: Chris Brown]
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin'
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
She love the way, she love the way
She loves the way, the way it feels
When her body touch, her body touch your grill

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
When I'm hittin' and grillin' you know she love that
Call her semi automatic, cause she bust back
And it's time she my now and later
She be beggin' me to annihilate her
When it's over she'll need the undertaker, killed that
Your body's shakin' girl, I feel that
It's mine forever, we grind together
And when you put them slugs in, we even shine together
And I love that and I think she knows that
Whenever she around it, gotta go down
She said she only fuckin' with them thugs
But nobody handcuffin' baby, no doubt
Cause we both know what it was
She loves

[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
I brought out the Zoo, ain't gon' fuck with you baby
I set 'em down, take 'em to school for you baby
Bustin' out the window, how I'm feelin' you baby
And people say we crazy, just the shit we do baby
And she love a hood nigga, show her how to flip it
Everybody stingy, yeah we stackin' and we spendin'
Ay it sound like a water slide when I’m in it
And we 'bout business so we know let's get it
And we love those gold slugs baby
I beat it up, gold gloves baby
And let 'em talk, they don’t know nothin' baby
These niggas broke tryna hold some baby

She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
She love the way, she love the way
She loves the way, the way it feels
